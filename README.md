## These codes are mainly a reproduction of my results from the literature on GKS (Gas-Knietic Theory)
- KFVS_1st_order_1D_case.cpp: This code is to compute the flow problem in the one-dimensional case using the **1st order KFVS scheme**, and three classical cases are computed, include Sod shock tube, Sjogreen Supersonic Expansion Case and Woodward-Colella Test Case.
